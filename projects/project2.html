        lack of reason to initiate conversation (explicitly mentioned)

      <p class="text">
        Apart from busy life, ‘lack of reason to initiate conversation with neighbors’ is the biggest factor that’s contributing to social disconnection. walking up to neighbors house without any reason may result in awkwardness and anxiety.

      <p class="sub-sub-heading">
        Socializing is not Fun and useful
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        the absence of fun and usefulness element in socializing may be leading people to stay disconnected where they’d rather choose solitary entertainment like binge-watching movies or gaming instead of socializing.
      </p>
      <p class="sub-sub-heading">
        Absence of dedicated channel to socialize
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        with Absence of dedicated channel to to socialize with neighbors, people are often limited to chance encounters and brief interactions like saying “hi good morning” when they confront their neighbor. These brief interactions may not be enough to establish meaningful connections or friendships.

        Following a productive brainstorming session, I generated numerous ideas and carefully selected two ideas which can successfully satisfy all the requirements mentioned earlier.

      <h2 class="heading">1 . ‘ Favors ’ as a medium to connect people</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Who doesn’t need help once in a while, all of us have experienced situations where a small act of kindness from someone could make a significant difference while doing something and my idea is design an app which uses ‘act of helping’ as a medium to bring people together.

        <li><p class="text">This gives an individual a reason to go talk to their neighbors.</p></li>

          <p class="text">my inspiration to this idea came from remembrance of my visit to my grandparents house. Unlike cities, villages lack commercial services or businesses for people to hire for various household chores. As a result, when villagers need assistance with a complex task at home, they often rely on their neighbors for help, and while working together they talk and share a lot about their day, family, events, opinions, interests etc... and I believe this sharing of thoughts brings them together.</p>

      <h2 class="heading">2 . Neighborhood bonding activities</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Assigning series of engaging and collaborative activities to a neighborhood can bring people together, sparks joy and encourages socializing. it offers a chance for people to step out of their daily routines and work together towards a common goal. these shared experiences, can cultivate a stronger sense of community and make lasting connections with neighbors.
