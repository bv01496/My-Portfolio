      <li><p class="text">Some consumers prefer offline shopping because it gives them a <span class="highlight">sense of confidence and safety,</span> knowing that they can <span class="highlight">hold someone accountable</span> if something goes wrong with the product they purchased.</p></li>
      <li><p class="text"><span class="highlight">Instant gratification </span>is a key driver of consumer shopping habits, which is why online shopping may not be an option for those <span class="highlight">who need things immediately.</span></p></li>
